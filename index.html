    <h1>My Story</h1>
    <p>I chose to take the class Mobile Friendly Websites because I know where the technology is headed and everything now is portability. Whether it be a phone or tablet. Being able to make a website responsive is amazing. I cannot wait to improve every day. The journey is just beginning.</p>
